<h2>We help students succeed in STEM</h2>
<h3><i>Coding and robotics workshops for learners age 3 and up</i></h3>
</blockquote>

#### OUR MISSION
We are a Minnesota based 501(c)(3) non-profit whose mission is to show girls and BIPOC students that technology skills are available to anyone with an interest, and to cultivate that interest in as many learners as possible. We believe that diversity is essential to our future success, and that we all do better when we all do better.


#### OUR WORKSHOPS
Our workshops have helped over 300 students succeed at coding, robotics, and engineering. All of our donations go back into providing our robot kits and instructional materials as cheaply as possible, and we rely on grants to cover our operational costs.
